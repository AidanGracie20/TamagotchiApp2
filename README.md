Assignment 2
Creating a working Tamagotchi application


Assignment 2 was based off Tamagotchis. Tamagotchis originated from
Toshima City in Tokyo, Japan, in 1996 where they developed a virtual toy in which
the user would tend to the animal/ pet. The purpose is to ensure the animal is always
kept healthy (by feeding it) and cared for (through good hygiene and entertainment)).
In this assignment I was required to create a working Tamagotchi app, with personal
aspects in regard to design etc.
 (An example of the virtual toy known as the Tamagotchi where users are tasked with looking after the needs of a virtual animal)

Due to Tamagotchis generally being created for children, I focused my design to fit appropriately to this. The design of the small, cozy room, the window
looking out to the night sky (with vibrant lights hung across it), creates a warm
atmosphere and is very appealing to those using the app. The idea behind the room
is the feeling of home and a space full of care (including the essentials of food,
hygiene and leisure time which is crucial for children). The red panda is animated to
also fit perfectly in with the animated background and the child-like style for the
users. The red panda was an inspiration from my girlfriend who absolutely adores
them. Each panda image was taken from Pinterest (https://za.pinterest.com/) . The red panda in the introduction page is sitting on the floor while stating a warm welcome message
saying “Hi, I’m ROONEY the red panda”. Having a name for the animal makes the
app more personal for the user as though they are bonding.





(This is the welcome page)

 Each other image of the red panda is associated for the different tasks (“clean”, “feed”, and “play”). To ensure the visual appearance is aesthetically appealing to the eye, I made the colour of the task buttons to match the background (predominantly being the same yellow colour as the curtains). The “back” button however, is a light blue colour (which matches the
colour of the cupboard). The writing is in a bold, black colour to stand out and catch the viewer’s attention. 



                                 (Second page showing                                 ( (Resultant page showing 
                                 The “feed”, “play” and                                      what happens when you  
                                 “Clean”, as well as the                                     choose the button “Feed” 
                                 “Back” button)                                                  When you click “Feed” the
                                                                                                          Progress bar will fill up) 

Kotlin is a powerful, concise, and expressive language that is crafted by JetBrains. One of Kotlin’s main functions is its ability to handle large datasets very well and quickly. Kotlin is also very helpful when designing your application. Kotlin’s best function is creating android applications. With them all having many different functions, with this application being used to create a Tamagotchi application, an old Japanese virtual toy, where the individual is tasked with looking after a specific animal, the individual has to feed, play and clean the animal, the animal in question for this application is a Red Panda, a type of mammal indigenous to parts of Asia, that’s why it was fitting to use the Red Panda as my animal in the Japanese Tamagotchi application. Kotlin has many features that can be used to create your applications, such as buttons, text boxes and many more widgets, the features that I mainly used were the buttons and progress bars, while also adding in various images of the Red Panda, playing, being fed, being cleaned and just sitting and saying hello to the user.

The interface of the first page which is the welcome page involves, the Red Panda and a button saying “Get started” which when you click the button, it is coded to take you to the next page. First, I declared the button then added the code that will take you to the next page, so when the app is running at you click the button “get started”, it perfectly takes you to the next page. Then the next page is called MainActivity2, this is where the user decides whether they want to feed, clean or play with Rooney the Red Panda, depending what button you push either “feed”, “play” or “clean”, it will take you to another screen where you will feed, play or clean the animal. Each page has a unique image reflecting the action taking place and each page has two buttons, one saying feed, play or clean which when clicked will fill up the progress bar by 20 percent each time you push the button until it reaches the maximum of 100 and then once you move on and go on to another page, the progress bar will reset. The other button on the page is a “Back” button which when clicked will take the user back to the page where they will select what task to complete with Rooney. 

 
(The coding for the second page, this is how it takes you to the other pages)


 
          
(This is the user interface for the Feed section and the code for it where the user will click the “feed” button and each click of the “feed” button will fill the progress bar until the Red Panda is full or has been played with or been cleaned for example. The two below pictures show the progress bar after 1 click and the second picture shows the progress bar after 5 clicks resulting in a full animal.)


Another part of assignment 2 was uploading all the code to GitHub and running tests on there. My code has been successfully uploaded to GitHub. Firstly, I created a public repository and uploaded my code, then added a ReadME file, which this comprehensive report will go in when I am finished this essay. 
 
 
(Example of my GitHub repository and my code being uploaded on GitHub)

I successfully completed the Assignment 2 by getting my app to work smoothly through sufficient coding, unique design, and lastly that it met the requirements of the Tamagotchi. Users would be able to “feed”, “clean” and “play” with ROONEY just as they could care for the animals in the virtual toy known as the Tamagotchi created in Japan. I have uploaded all my code to GitHub and supplied a very detailed YouTube video that shows what the app can do as well as take you through the coding itself as well as the GitHub repository and all the code on there as well as the comprehensive report.
